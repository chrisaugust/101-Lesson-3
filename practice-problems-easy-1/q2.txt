1. != means not equal to. It can be used as a test conditions for control
 flow. eg return "Dog ate it!" if homework != 'turned in'

2. ! before a variable means 'not'.
It changes the truthiness of that variable. Which means
in practice that if <variable> is set to false or nil, !<variable> will evaluate to true, and for all other cases !<variable> will evaluate to false.


3. The ! in words.uniq! is a signal that the method mutates the caller.

4. ? before something indicates a ternary operator.

5. ? after something indicates that the preceding something is a method, and most likely one that is booleanish, ie it returns true/false.

6. !! is the opposite of !. It turns an object into its boolean value.
